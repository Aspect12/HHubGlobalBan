[VERSION: 8/6]

INFORMATION:
The Half-Life 2 Roleplay Hub Global Ban System is a plugin that adds a Global Ban system to your server. Malicious individuals such as cheaters, minge-group members, griefers, and more are added to this list and get banned from each server that has this plugin installed; allowing you to focus on creating a fun experience for your players without having to worry about dealing with the same people over and over again. The ban list is managed by me, and only I can add onto the list, so it is not exploitable in any way. The plugin also features a 'Version Control' system. If there is ever a new version of the plugin released, you will see a message on your server console when you start up your server.

If you wish to submit an HGB entry request, contact Aspectâ„¢#5665 or join the HHub Discord Server (https://discord.gg/hyPtDAF) and provide the SteamID of the player in question, along with sufficient proof of what they have done.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
(This plugin is Schema-Agnostic. That means it is not restricted to only the Half-Life 2 Roleplay Schema.)

For the Clockwork Framework, navigate to the "Clockwork" folder and upload the "hh_globalban" folder into your server, in the "garrysmod/gamemodes/cwhl2rp/plugins/" directory.
For the Nutscript and Helix Framework, navigate to the "Nutscript & Helix" folder and upload the "hh_globalban.lua" file into your server, in the "garrysmod/gamemodes/nshl2rp(or ixhl2rp respectfully)/plugins/" directory.

VERSION 8/6 CHANGELOG:
The plugin has received a few optimizations, as well as a new, more descriptive kick message.
Specifically, the plugin now performs SteamID checks as soon as the player connects to the server, and the new kick message provides a few possible causes as to why they may be banned, with instructions on how to appeal their ban.
In addition, players now get kicked, as opposed to getting banned, enabling easier Global Ban List entry appeals.
Finally, to expand in our continuous effort to ensure that the plugin is unbiased, the plugin has been altered to only kick players if there is definitive proof for what they have done. If there is no definitive proof for what they have done, they will be allowed access to the server, but all online server administrators will be notified of their arrival.

VERSION 7/5 CHANGELOG:
The plugin now uses new links to fetch the banlist from the web.

VERSION 6/4 CHANGELOG:
The plugin now uses new links to fetch the banlist from the web.

VERSION 5/3 CHANGELOG:
The plugin has received some minor optimizations for the whitelist system.

VERSION 4/2 CHANGELOG:
The plugin now features a whitelist system. For more information and instructions, look into the "sh_whitelist.lua" file in the Clockwork version of the plugin and in the "hh_globalban.lua" file in the Nutscript/Helix version respectfully.
